Description: This package scrapes abstract text from publisher web pages based on a 
    digital object identifier (DOI) input. The functions account for articles lacking 
    abstracts, those with sectioned abstracts (e.g. background, methods, results, 
    discussion), and abstracts of varying lengths.
